# Todo Management Example (Full Implementation)

This document walks through a complete, real-world implementation of WAP in a todo management application. It includes the full manifest definition, API endpoint implementations, user interaction flows, and step-by-step execution traces showing how natural language commands like "Push all incomplete todos due this week to next Monday" are transformed into coordinated API calls.

*This resource is currently being developed and will be available soon.*
