# Security Model Deep Dive

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of WAP's security architecture. It covers how WAP leverages existing browser security mechanisms (same-origin policy, CORS, CSRF protection), explains why WAP is resistant to prompt injection attacks that plague DOM-based solutions, details authentication and authorization patterns, and provides security best practices for implementing WAP-enabled endpoints. Includes threat modeling and mitigation strategies.

*This resource is currently being developed and will be available soon.*
